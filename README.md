# chemical_assistant

## Project Overview

This is a chemical reaction modeling assistant tool that builds upon and extends the ChemPy library. It provides enhanced functionality for chemical reaction modeling and analysis.

### Core Components

The project consists of several key modules:

1. **Chemistry Module** (`library/chemistry.py`)
   - Core chemical calculations and data handling
   - Extension of ChemPy's base functionality

2. **Reaction System** (`library/reactionsystem.py`)
   - Handles chemical reaction systems
   - Based on ChemPy's reaction system implementation
   - Additional features for reaction modeling

3. **Equilibria Module** (`library/equilibria.py`)
   - Chemical equilibrium calculations
   - Enhanced equilibrium solving capabilities
   - Integration with ChemPy's equilibria system

4. **Equation System** (`library/_eqsys.py`)
   - Low-level equation system solver
   - Mathematical backbone for chemical calculations

## Dependencies

Required packages:
- NumPy
- SciPy
